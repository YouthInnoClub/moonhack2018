# Moon Landing Game based on Lunar Lander from Dan Q (all the credit go to its original author Dan Q)

This project was remixed from Dan Q's Lunar Lander game, and specifically modified for Moonhack 2018

Come to this link and play the Moon Landing game

https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/7d49be7054

game rule, the landing speed should be less than 5 m/s, and the more fuel reserved (better than 40%), the high chance of survive, usually, any fuel reserve higher than 45% is pretty good, enjoy!!!

READ THE ORIGINAL README FILE from Dan Q

HTML5/JS (ES6) "Lunar Lander" game. Pilot a lunar module down the the surface of the moon, firing the boosters as necessary (touch screen, hold mouse button, or depress any key) to touch down at a safe speed of 4 m/s or less without running out of fuel. Fuel represents about half of the weight of the lunar module and so burning fuel reduces your inertia.

Designed as an experiment into very-simply adapting HTML5 canvas games to work in different resolutions and on a variety of devices. Port/reimagining of a project I wrote in Turbo Pascal in 1997, during my A-levels.
