ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. 
The ESP32 series employs a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations and includes 
in-built antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. 
ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using 
their 40 nm process.[2] It is a successor to the ESP8266 microcontroller.

This project was built as demo project for Moon Landing theme, it has the LED light changing and sound effect on the 
background.
