This project a demo project using AppInventor2 to create a nice moon landing theme.

App Inventor for Android is an open-source web application originally provided by Google, and now maintained by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

It allows newcomers to computer programming to create software applications for the Android operating system (OS). 
It uses a graphical interface, very similar to Scratch and the StarLogo TNG user interface, which allows users to 
drag-and-drop visual objects to create an application that can run on Android devices. In creating App Inventor, 
Google drew upon significant prior research in educational computing, as well as work done within Google on online 
development environments.
